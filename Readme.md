## General Feedback

### The Good

I enjoyed the assessment and found it really interesting how it has been structured. I really enjoyed the first part of the assessment and was even exploring ways in which I could refactor the code for the challenges. I feel that it was a nice recap of C# programming which I had not touched in years. The second half proved to be challenging due to how I am more familiar with the .Net Core Framework which while familiar had some subtle differences to the .Net Framework the project is built on.

### The Frustrations

My frustrations arose when I was trying to do something using methods I know from .Net Core which were not working with the project. I reached countless roadblocks in attempting Q5 part 2 where I was trying to use the Microsoft.EntityframeworkCore.SqlServer which I was accustomed to using in the projects I have done in C# but it wasn't compatible at all with the current project. Due to the time constraints, I found that some of the latter questions I could have been able to complete had I skipped the second part of question 5 which proved to be a challenge for me.

### Lessons Learned

I have learned that there are still tonnes of things to learn on C# alone and while with my recent projects I have been working with completely different languages i.e. python, nodejs, and php. This has roused my interests in working with C#.
